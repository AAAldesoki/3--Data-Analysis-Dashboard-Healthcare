# 3- Data Analysis Dashboard (Healthcare) <sub>Project_3</sub>

## Summary:
This project showcases a comprehensive Patient Wait List Analytics Dashboard, designed to analyze and optimize patient wait times across various specialties and case types. Built in Power BI, the dashboard provides actionable insights into patient backlogs, case trends, and areas requiring immediate attention to improve healthcare service delivery.


## Project Goals: 
1. Track current status of patient waiting list.
2. Analyze historical monthly trend of waiting list in Inpatient & Outpatient categories 
3. Detailed specialty level & age profile analysis 


## Metrics Required: 
1. Average & Median Waiting List. 
2. Current Total Wait List.


## Views Required 
1. Summary Page.
2. Detailed Page for Granular Analysis.

## Key Highlights : 
**1. Wait List Overview:**
   - Latest Month Wait List: **`687.8K`**, a **`10%`** increase from the previous period.
   - Previous Month Wait List: **`622.6K`**, with a **`4%`** growth trend.
    
**2. Average Wait List by Case Type:**
   - Overall Average Wait Time: **`62.29`** days.
   - Distribution of wait times by case type:
     - Outpatient: **`87.68`** days ***(70.69%)***.
     - Day Case: **`22.42`** days ***(18.08%)***.
     - Inpatient: **`13.93`** days ***(11.23%)***.

**3. Time Band Analysis:**
   - Largest concentration of patients falls under the 0–3 months band, highlighting recent additions to the wait list.
   - Backlogs persist in longer time bands (12–18 months), requiring prioritization.

**4. Specialty-Specific Insights:**
   - Top 6 specialties with the highest average wait lists:
     - Paediatric Dermatology: **`167.89`** days.
     - Paediatric ENT: **`147.89`** days.
     - Accident & Emergency: **`111.19`** days.
     - Dermatology: **`105.92`** days.

**5. Trend Analysis (2018–2021):**
   - Steady growth in Outpatient Wait Lists from **`0.49M`** in 2018 to **`0.61M`** in 2021.
   - Declines in Day Case and Inpatient Wait Lists, reflecting reduced patient load in these categories.

## Insights and Recommendations: 
 **1. Address Specialty-Specific Backlogs:**
   - Prioritize reducing wait times in high-impact specialties such as Paediatric Dermatology and ENT, which have the highest delays.

 **2. Age-Based Intervention Plans:**
   - Focus on the 65+ age group, particularly in longer time bands (18+ months), to address critical care needs for elderly patients.

 **3. Optimize Outpatient Management:**
   - With 70% of total wait times attributed to outpatient cases, efforts should focus on improving outpatient scheduling and capacity.

 **4. Analyze Recent Additions to Wait Lists:**
   - The 0–3 months time band shows a high influx of patients, requiring proactive management to prevent long-term backlogs.

 **5. Monitor Trends Over Time:**
   - Investigate the growth in outpatient numbers since 2018 and maintain reductions in inpatient and day case backlogs.
